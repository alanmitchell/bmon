        Insert records for the calculated reading using the function with the name
        'calcFuncName' and having the parameters 'calcParams'.  The inserted readings
        have a sensor ID of 'calc_id'.  The method returns the number of records inserted.

        'calcFuncName' is a string giving the name of a method of this class.  The method
        is used to calculate new readings for the sensor database.  'calcParams' is one string
        that is formatted like the keyword parameters of a function call; for example:
            heat_capacity=1.08, flow=60
        
        There are two categories of functions that can be named by 'calcFuncName':
            *  Functions that expect at least one of the parameters to be the ID of an 
            sensor (or prior calculated field) that already exists in the sensor
            database.
            *  Functions that do not need to have existing sensor readings as inputs.
            An example is a function that acquires weather data from the Internet.
        In the section of this class where the calculation functions are given, the functions
        are split into these two categories.

        For functions in the first category (those that operate on existing sensor readings),
        you can pass an array of existing sensor readings to the function by prefacing a
        keyword parameter with the string 'id_'.  Using the 'fluidHeatFlow' function as an 
        example, if you want the function to operate on the flow readings recorded by sensor
        12345, you would pass the parameter:
            id_flow="12345"
            (all sensor IDs are strings and are therefore quoted, although code has been
            included to assume a string even if the quotes are forgotten)
        If instead there were no flow sensor readings but you know the flow to have the value
        of 60.5, you would pass:
            flow=60.5
        in the 'calcParams' string.

        If you are using multiple existing sensor readings as inputs to the calculation function,
        the timestamps of the calculated values are synchronized with one of the sensors. To
        designate the sensor to be used for synchronization, append '_sync' to that parameter
        name.  For example, to synchronize on the flow sensor in the 'fluidHeatFlow' function,
        pass:
            id_flow_sync="12345"
        For the other sensor inputs, sensor values are interpolated to the timestamps of the 
        synchronized sensor.

        For functions that don't operate on existing sensor values, the functions must return a
        list of timestamps and a list of calculated values, since there are no existing sensor
        timestamps to synchronize to.
