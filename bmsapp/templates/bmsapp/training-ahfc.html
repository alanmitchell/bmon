            <td>(10 minutes) This video gives a brief overview the AHFC Building Monitoring System project.  The BMS
            website is introduced, but no detailed training for the website is provided in this video.</td>

            <td>(9 minutes) This video shows how to select various various reports and graphs for each building.
            The video also explains a number of graphing features, such as zooming, highlighting points, and hiding
            data series on the graph.  These features are common to all the graphs on the web site, and this
            video is an important one to watch prior to watching the videos below.</td>

            <td>(13 minutes) This video explains the graphs that are available to compare energy use across
            multiple buildings that are being monitored.  It also describes the "Current Values" report, which
            shows the current sensor readings for any one building.</td>

            <td>(8 minutes) This video explains the "Plot over Time" graph, also known as the "Time Series" plot.
            This graph lets you graph how one or more sensor values change over time.  This is the
            workhorse graph of the system, so this video is important.</td>

            <td>(8 minutes) This video explains the "Hourly Profile" chart.
            This graph lets you graph how a sensor's value changes across the hours in the day.  It also allows
            you to select particular days to look at, such as Monday through Friday or just Saturday.</td>

            <td>(6 minutes) This video explains the Histogram chart.
            This graph is good for learning about the range of values measured by a sensor.  It also shows you
            the values are recorded most frequently and least frequently.</td>
