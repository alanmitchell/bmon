    """ Returns a dictionary of information derived from the payload sent by 
    a Things Network HTTP Integration.  Some general data about the message is included
    (e.g. Unix timestamp) but a full list of the sensor values encoded in the payload are returned
    in the 'fields' key of the dictionary. The value of the 'fields' item is a List of tuples:
    the first element of the tuple is the field name, and the second element is typically a
    numeric value of the field.  The one exception is that the second element can be a
    two-element tuple containing: (field value, time offset in seconds).  A non-zero time
    offset means the sensor value occurred at an offset from the time the LoRa message
    was received; it is generally a negative offset value meaning it occurred prior in time.
    
    If already-decoded payload fields are not present, only sensor values from the 
    following sensors can currently be decoded from the raw payload:
        All Elsys sensors
        Dragino LHT65, LWL01, LDDS20, LDDS75, LSN50v2
           Also, a special decoding of the LT22222 sensor for boat monitoring is included.
