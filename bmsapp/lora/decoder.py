    """ Returns a dictionary of information derived from the payload sent by 
    a Things Network HTTP Integration.  Some general data about the message is included
    (e.g. Unix timestamp) but a full list of the sensor values encoded in the payload are returned
    in the 'fields' key of the dictionary. These value are pulled from the 'payload_fields' key of
    the integration_payload (if present) or by decoding the raw_payload.  The 'raw_payload_priority' parameter 
    determines which source has priority. Only sensor values from the following sensors can currently be
    decoded from the raw payload:
        All Elsys sensors
        Drgaino LHT65 sensors
    
    Function Parameters are:
    'integration_payload': the data payload that is sent by a Things Network HTTP integration, 
        in Python dictionary format.
    'flatten_value_lists': some sensors, including the Elsys ELT-2, decode multiple sensor channels 
        into a list of values, for example multiple external temperature channels.  If this parameter
        is True (the default), those lists are flattened into separate sensor values by appending
        the list index to the sensor name.
    'raw_payload_priority': If True (the default), an attempt will be made first to decode the raw payload; if that
        fails and there is a 'payload_fields' key in the integration post, those values will be used.
