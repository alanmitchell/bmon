        'rolling_average': If set to True, a rolling average is computed for each
        of the sensor values before the 'expression' is calculated.  For this rolling
        average, the time period used is given by the 'averaging_hours' parameter.  
        Fractional hours are truncated to the lesser minute. A calculated reading is
        returned for each timestamp that occurs for sensor A.  So, the calculated reading
        for a particular timestamp ts will encompass sensor values that occur in the
        interval of (ts - averaging_hours) to ts.

        'time_label': This parameter determines where the timestamp is placed when
        averaging is requested (both types of averaging, rolling or standard).
        The valid values are 'left', 'right', 'center' (the default). 'center', the
        default, places the timestamp at the center of the averaging period. 'left' places
        the timestamp at the left (earliest) edge of the interval. 'right' places it
        at the right (latest) edge of the interval.
        
        This routine only returns calculated values for timestamps after the last
        calculated readings stored in the reading database.
