<p>This page contains Reports, Presentations and a number of Videos that explain how to use the ANTHC Remote
Monitoring website.  This website is based upon a website developed for the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC)
Building Monitoring System project.  Most of the reports and training material below come from that project.</p>

<h2>Reports and Presentations</h2>

<p><a href="http://bms.ahfconline.net/static/bmsapp/reports/deliverable_2_6_7.pdf"><b>Final Report for the Alaska Housing 
Finance Corporation (AHFC) Building Monitoring System Project:</b></a> Design 
of the Monitoring Systems, Benefits from Monitoring various System Types, Installation Tips, 
Internet Access Issues.</p>

<h2>Training Videos</h2>

            <td>(9 minutes) This video shows how to select various various reports and graphs for each facility.
            The video also explains a number of graphing features, such as zooming, highlighting points, and hiding
            data series on the graph.  These features are common to all the graphs on the web site, and this
            video is an important one to watch prior to watching the videos below.</td>

            multiple buildings, a feature not implemented for the ANTHC Remote Montioring project.  
            However, it also describes the "Current Values" report, which is implemented in this site.  This
            report shows the current sensor readings for any one facility.</td>

            This graph lets you graph how one or more sensor values change over time.  This is the
            workhorse graph of the system, so this video is important.</td>

            This graph lets you graph how a sensor's value changes across the hours in the day.  It also allows
            you to select particular days to look at, such as Monday through Friday or just Saturday.</td>

            This graph is good for learning about the range of values measured by a sensor.  It also shows you
            the values are recorded most frequently and least frequently.</td>
