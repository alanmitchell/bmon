How to Install BMON on a Web Server
===================================

**NOTE:** For an automated installation script that can install BMON
on a Linux server, please see the `bmon-install GitHub Project <https://github.com/alanmitchell/bmon-install>`_.

This document describes how to install the BMON application on a web
server. The specific steps shown here apply to installation on the
`Webfaction Hosting Service <https://www.webfaction.com/>`_, which has
been used for most of the installations of the BMON application. The
general goals of each step of the installation are also described, to
assist in installation on other hosting providers or a standalone server.

The assumption here is that BMON will be installed on a server running
the Linux operating system, although installation on a Windows server is
also possible (the ``backup_db()`` method in the
`bmsdata.py <https://github.com/alanmitchell/bmon/blob/master/bmsapp/readingdb/bmsdata.py>`_ file uses
the ``gzip`` Linux utility, which can be installed on Windows through
use of `Cygwin <https://www.cygwin.com/>`_). The skills needed for installation are primarily:

*  Linux command line skills.
*  Some experience with `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and the `Django
   web framework <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ would be helpful,
   as the BMON application is a Python application built using the
   Django web framework. If you are using the Wefaction hosting
   services, these skills are not absolutely necessary, as step-by-step
   installation instructions for that hosting service are detailed below.
   If you are *not* using the Webfaction hosting service, more Django
   and Python skills will be required, as the instructions below will
   need to be modified to fit your configuration.
*  Some knowledge of the `Git version control
   system <http://git-scm.com/>`_ would be helpful.

Create the Website and Install the Django Application
-----------------------------------------------------

The BMON application needs to have Django 2.2.1 or greater and Python 3.7
or greater installed. On the Webfaction hosting service, Python 3.7 is already
installed, so none of the steps below perform that task. If installing
on a system without Python 3.7, you will first need to install Python.
The rest of the steps below install Django 2.2.1 or greater, and configure the
server to use Django to serve requests being made on the Domain you will
use for the BMON application.

The steps in this section are patterned after the general `Webfaction
documentation for installing Django <http://docs.webfaction.com/software/django/getting-started.html>`_.

#. Log into the Webfaction Control Panel and click ``DOMAINS/WEBSITES``
   from the menu bar.

#. Click the button ``Add new website``.

#. In the ``Name`` field, type in ``bmon``.

#. It is highly recommended that an Encrypted website (https) be
   created, because the BMON application utilizes a password-protected
   log in screen for administrative access to the application. Those
   passwords will travel the Internet encrypted if an https site is
   used. Select ``Encrypted website (https)``. You will need to install
   an SSL certificate in order for users to not receive a security
   warning when they access the site. For the Webfaction host, `see
   their SSL documentation <http://docs.webfaction.com/user-guide/websites.html#secure-sites-https>`_.

#. In the ``Domains`` field, select or type in the domain or subdomain
   where you want to access the BMON site. For this example, we are
   accessing the site on the subdomain
   ``bmon.ahfctest.webfactional.com``, so we type that into the field.
   If your domain does not exist, you will get a prompt that will allow
   you to create the domain or subdomain.

#. Click the ``Add an application`` button and select
   ``Create a new application``.

   *  For the ``Name`` of the application, use ``bmon_django``; the
      ``App category`` is ``Django``; the ``App type`` is a Django
      release of 2.2.1 or greater,
      paired with Python 3.7. Leave the other fields at their default
      values. Click the ``Save`` button to complete the Application
      setup.

#. Now we need to create another application to serve static files for
   the BMON application such as JavaScript files, stylesheets, and
   images. As before, click the ``Add an application`` button and select
   ``Create a new application``.

   *  For the ``Name`` of the application, use ``bmon_static``; the
      ``App category`` is ``Static``; the ``App type`` is
      ``Static only (no .htaccess)``; enter ``static`` into the URL
      field (for the example, the final value in that field reads
      ``https://bmon.ahfctest.webfactional.com/static``). Click the
      ``Save`` button to complete the Application setup.

#. The website configuration is now complete. The website screen in this
   example looks like:

.. image:: /_static/website_create.png

9. Click the ``Save`` button on the website screen to complete the
   application setup.

10. Test progress by going to your website URL
    (``https://bmon.ahfctest.webfactional.com`` in this example) and you
    should get an "It Worked" page in response. This may not function
    immediately, as some time is required for the server to process
    website configuration.

Set Up Email on the Web Server
------------------------------

The BMON application has the ability to send out notifications when
sensor values are outside of normal ranges. In order to do this, BMON
needs the ability to send emails. For the Webfaction hosting service,
email setup is described on `this
page <http://docs.webfaction.com/user-guide/email.html#sending-mail-to-a-script>`_.
The minimum requirements for the BMON application are to set up one
mailbox and one email address on the Webfaction system. For example,
with a Webfaction user account name of ``ahfc``, you could set a mailbox
with the name of ``ahfc`` and an email address of
``monitoring@ahfc.webfactional.com``. In a subsequent section, the
mailbox name, password, and email address will be needed for entry
in the BMON Settings File.

Installing the BMON Project
---------------------------

In this step, the Python code for the BMON project is installed and
connected to the Django application.

#. Open an SSH session to the web host.

#. Navigate to the Django application directory by entering
   ``cd $HOME/webapps/bmon_django`` and pressing Enter.

#. We first need to remove the sample project that was created when we
   installed Django. Enter ``rm -rf ./myproject`` and press Enter.

#. Clone the BMON project into this directory by executing:

   ::

       git clone https://github.com/alanmitchell/bmon.git

   You should now have a ``bmon`` directory containing the BMON
   software.

#. Changes are required so that Django runs this project instead of the
   ``myproject`` project you just removed. Execute the
   ``cd $HOME/webapps/bmon_django/apache2/conf`` command to move to that
   directory. Then, change all the occurrences of ``myproject`` to
   ``bmon`` in the file ``httpd.conf`` by executing the following
   command:

   ::

       sed -i "s/myproject/bmon/g" httpd.conf

   Alternatively, you can use an editor to replace occurrences of
   ``myproject`` with ``bmon`` in the ``httpd.conf`` file.

Install Python Packages
-----------------------

The BMON application uses some code libraries that do not come with
Python. In this section, these libraries will be installed with Python's
pip package manager using a requirements.txt file that lists the required
packages.

For installing on Webfaction, first change into the BMON directory,
``cd $HOME/webapps/bmon_django/bmon``, and then run the following command:

::

    pip3.7 install --user -r requirements.txt

This command can take a few minutes to complete. There is some chance the
installation process will be killed due to excessive memory usage
(probably while installing the ``pandas`` package, and you will receive
an email to that effect from Webfaction. The email will contain a link
that will take you to a Webfaction Support ticket. Inform Webfaction
that you are temporarily installing Python packages, and they will
temporarily relax the memory limit.

Creating the BMON Settings File
--------------------------------------

Django requires a ``settings.py`` file to provide essential information
for running a project. We will start with a sample settings file and
make necessary changes.

*  Move to the ``$HOME/webapps/bmon_django/bmon/bmon`` directory (yes,
   the ``bmon`` folder inside the ``bmon`` folder) and create a
   ``settings.py`` file from the sample located there:

   ::

       cp settings_example.py settings.py

*  Open ``settings.py`` in an editor, e.g. ``nano settings.py``. Each
   one of the settings is documented within the file. Examine each setting
   carefully for any needed changes.

   Write down the BMSAPP_STORE_KEY that you created, as this will be
   needed when you are setting up sensors to post to the BMON system.

Create the Django Database, Install Initial Data, and Prepare Static Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. Go to the main project directory
   ``cd $HOME/webapps/bmon_django/bmon`` or ``cd ..`` if you just
   finished the prior step.

#. Create the Django database file by executing:

   ::

       ./manage.py migrate

#. Some initial data for common sensor units, sensor categories, and a
   sample building and sensor should be loaded into the database by:

   ::

       ./manage.py loaddata init_data.yaml

#. Copy the static files (images, stylesheets, JavaScript files, etc.)
   into the folder where they will be served by the Static Application
   you created. Do this by executing:

   ::

       ./manage.py collectstatic

#. In order to use the Admin site for setting up sensors and buildings,
   we need to create an admin user. To do this, execute:

   ::

       ./manage.py createsuperuser

   Enter your desired username, email, and password to complete the
   setup. The username and password created here will be the credentials
   needed to log into the Admin side of the BMON site.

#. The final stage of the process is to restart the Apache web server.
   Change to Apache’s bin directory by executing
   ``cd $HOME/webapps/bmon_django/apache2/bin``. Enter ``./restart`` and
   press Enter. You should now be able to view the new BMON site by
   browsing to the Domain URL that you set up in the initial section of
   this installation. You should also be able to access the Admin
   portion of the site by browsing to ``<Domain URL>/admin/`` and
   logging in with the Admin user credentials setup in in step 5 of this
   section.

#. If you run into any problems with your new Django application using
   the Webfaction hosting service, see `Django
   Troubleshooting <http://docs.webfaction.com/software/django/troubleshooting.html#django-troubleshooting>`_.

Cron Jobs
---------

One cron job is necessary for the BMON application. To edit the your
crontab file, execute ``crontab -e``. Then, add the following line to
the file, making changes to the path if BMON was installed in a
non-standard directory:

::

    */5 * * * * cd ~/webapps/bmon_django/bmon && ./manage.py runscript main_cron > /dev/null 2>&1

This cron job: 

* creates calculated reading values and stores Internet weather data in
  the reading database every half hour
* checks for active Alert Conditions every five minutes
* runs any Periodic Scripts that been configured in the BMON system
* creates a daily status line in the log file indicating how many sensor
  readings were stored in the database during the past day (viewable by
  browsing to ``<Domain URL>/show_log``)
* creates a backup of the main Django database every day, and
* creates a backup of the reading database every three days

Note that the command executed by the cron job has two parts: 1) first, it
changes into the base BMON directory, and then it executes the manage.py script.
This two step process is necessary on the Webfaction server because the Django Python
package may only be available for scripts executed from a BMON directory.

If you choose to implement an off-server backup strategy, as described in
:ref:`archiving-and-analyzing-data-from-the-system`
you may have an additional cron job task.

Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS
-------------------------

If you want to automatically redirect users who browse to the unsecured
HTTP domain name for your site, you can set up HTTP to HTTPS
redirection. For the Webfaction hosting service, this process is
`described on this
page <http://docs.webfaction.com/software/static.html#static-redirecting-from-http-to-https>`_.
**However**, it is important to modify the ``.htaccess`` lines to the
following:

::

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-SSL} !on
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,NE,L]

The ``NE`` parameter on the last line ensures that the redirection does
not distort certain query strings that may appear in the URLs.

Time Savers
-----------

It is useful, but optional, to define a couple aliases in your
``.bashrc`` file located in the home directory. These will allow for
quick navigation to the BMON application directory and easy restarting
of the Django application:

::

    alias cddj='cd ~/webapps/bmon_django/bmon'
    alias rsdj='~/webapps/bmon_django/apache2/bin/restart'

Steps for Upgrading the BMON Software
-------------------------------------

Developers are frequently upgrading the BMON software on its main GitHub
repository. In order to update your installation to the latest version,
follow these steps:

#. Open an SSH shell session to the server.
#. Stop the Django application by navigating to the Apache bin
   directory, ``/home/<username>/webapps/bmon_django/apache2/bin`` and
   then executing the command ``./stop``.

#. Move to the ``$HOME/webapps/bmon_django/bmon`` project directory (or
   use the ``cddj`` alias if you defined one in your ``.bashrc`` file.)

#. Execute a ``git pull`` command to update your local copy of the BMON
   software to the most recent version.

#. Copy all the static files of the application to the folder where they
   are served from. Do this by executing the command
   ``./manage.py collectstatic``.

#. Perform any database modifications required by the upgrade by
   executing ``./manage.py migrate``.

#. Review the ``bmon/settings_example.py`` file to see if there are any
   new settings that are not present in your current
   ``bmon/settings.py`` file (``settings.py`` is not in version
   control). You do not need to look beyond the line:

   ::

       # ------- Generally shouldn't need to change anything beyond here -------

   If there are new settings required, edit your ``bmon/settings.py``
   file to include the new settings with appropriate values.

#. Restart the Django application by navigating to the Apache bin
   directory, ``/home/<username>/webapps/bmon_django/apache2/bin`` and
   then executing the command ``./start``.

#. Note that there is a shell script that performs these upgrade tasks and
   restarts the server.  The script is ``update.sh`` and is located in the
   root BMON directory: ``$HOME/webapps/bmon_django/bmon``.  If you need
   to edit values in the ``settings.py`` file, then you should use the manual
   upgrade steps to avoid the restart of the server that will occur with the
   shell script. 

Maintaining the Sensor Reading Database
---------------------------------------

The sensor readings posted to the BMON system are stored in a SQLite
database dedicated to that purpose. For information on the structure and
location of that database, see :ref:`archiving-and-analyzing-data-from-the-system`. Occasionally,
maintenance operations, outlier removal, data archival and other
database tasks need to be performed. One approach is to open a secure
shell connection (SSH) to the web server and use the ``sqlite3`` command
line tool to manipulate the database. Alternatively, a web-based
database administration tool can be installed onto the server, so that
manual database operations can be performed through a web interface. One
such tool is `phpLiteAdmin <https://code.google.com/p/phpliteadmin/>`_.
The tool allows viewing the sensor data, executing SQL statements, and
exporting sensor reading tables. Installation of the tool is
straight-forward and documented on the web page link above. When using
the Webfaction hosting service, installation of the ``Static/CGI/PHP``
application is required to run the phpLiteAdmin tool, as this tool is a
PHP web application.

Next Step: Add Buildings and Sensors
------------------------------------

The next step for configuring the BMON system is to use the Admin
interface available at ``<Domain URL>/admin/`` to enter buildings and
sensors into the system. See the :ref:`Adding Buildings and Sensors <adding-buildings-and-sensors>`
document for further explanation.
