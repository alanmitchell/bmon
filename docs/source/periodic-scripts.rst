Periodic Scripts
================

There are a number of tasks that are useful to run on a periodic basis,
such as:

*  Acquiring a batch of new sensor readings or data to store in BMON
   from
   a piece of equipment or server connected to the Internet.
*  Creating and sending a report on a periodic basis.
*  Sending data from the BMON database to a different database.
*  Performing a maintenance task.

The *Periodic Script* feature of BMON can be used for this purpose.
There are currently two Periodic Scripts available in BMON: 1) a script
to collect temperatures and other data from Ecobee thermostats, 2) a
script to collect data from an Okofen wood pellet boiler. Those Scripts
are discussed later in this document.

To set up a periodic script, go to the Home screen in the BMON Admin
interface and select "Periodic Scripts":

.. image:: /_static/main_scr_period_script.png
  :align: center

On the next screen, click the "ADD PERIODIC SCRIPT +" button in the
upper right corner of the screen. Below are the inputs required to
configure a Periodic Script, with example values:

.. image:: /_static/periodic_script_inputs.png
  :align: center

Each of these inputs is described below:

``File name of script`` The name of the file containing the Periodic
Script is entered here. Each of the Periodic Scripts is contained in a
separate Python file. Enter the name of that file here, but leave off
the ".py" file extension. In this example, the script is contained in
Python file named ``ecobee.py``. This is a script that retrieves
temperature, humidity, occupancy and other data from an Ecobee
thermostat. For the Periodic Scripts that are already available in BMON,
the proper name to fill in here will be provided in the specific
documentation for the script.

``Optional Description`` In this optional field, you can add comments
to document the purpose of the script. For this example, the
field is used to indicate that the script is retrieving data from the
Ecobee thermostat at the Mitchell home.

``How often should script run`` Choose a time interval indicating how
often the script should run. Intervals range from every 5 minutes to
every 24 hours.

``Script Parameters in YAML form`` Each script may allow the System Administrator 
to set additional configuration parameters through use of
*script parameters*. In the example here, an ``include_occupancy``
parameter is given with the value of ``true``. Multiple parameters can
be entered on separate lines in the box, using
`YAML <http://www.yaml.org/start.html>`_ notation. The valid script
parameters are documented for the specific script being run.

``Script results in YAML form`` This is *not* a User input but instead
displays results generated by the script the last time it was executed. 
For all scripts, the ``script_start_time`` is provided,
indicating when the script last ran. ``script_execution_time`` shows how
long in seconds it took for the script to run. If the script is one
that inserts new sensor readings into BMON, the
``reading_insert_message`` will indicate how many readings were
successfully inserted. The developer of the script can return any number
of values to be displayed here. Also, if errors occur running the
script, they will display here.

After configuring the Script, click the "SAVE" button in the lower right
corner of the screen to finalize your script. You can return to this
screen to examine the most current Script Results produced by the
script.

The rest of this document is used to discuss the currently available
Periodic Scripts in BMON. If you are a Developer and want to develop
custom Periodic Scripts, see the :ref:`periodic-scripts` document for 
additional information.

Collect Data from Ecobee Thermostats
------------------------------------

The ``ecobee`` Periodic Script collects sensor data from a set of
`Ecobee Thermostats <https://www.ecobee.com/>`_ belonging to one Ecobee
account. The script is capable of collecting the following sensor data:

*  Actual Temperature at the main Thermostat
*  Desired Heating Temperature (the heating "setpoint" temperature)
*  Relative Humidity at the main Thermostat
*  Occupancy Status at the main Thermostat (reads "Occupied" if there
   was motion detected in the last half hour)
*  The fraction of time that the Thermostat was calling for heat during
   each 5 minute interval
*  The Actual Temperatures at any remote sensors associated with the
   thermostat
*  The Occupancy status at any remote sensors associated with the
   thermostat

The script collects and stores this data in the BMON sensor reading
database for display through the normal BMON application.

Ecobee Authorization Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before BMON is allowed to pull data from an Ecobee account, two things
must happen:

*  An API Key must be obtained by an `Ecobee-registered developer <https://www.ecobee.com/developers/>`_. 
   This key must be entered into the :ref:`BMON Settings File <how-to-install-BMON-on-a-web-server>` 
   as the ``BMSAPP_ECOBEE_API_KEY`` settings entry. This
   is a one-time procedure done by the BMON System Administrator, not
   the owner of the Ecobee account.
*  For each Ecobee account where data extraction is desired, the *owner*
   of the account must authorize and add the BMON application to their
   Ecobee account. To do this:

   *  Navigate to the "ecobee-auth" web page in the BMON application. For
      example, here is the URL to the page for BMON on the
      Alaska Housing Finance server: https://bms.ahfc.us/ecobee-auth/ .
      Substitute the correct base URL for your server.
   *  The page will generate a 4-character PIN that needs to be entered
      into the Ecobee account. Follow the explicit instructions on the
      ``ecobee-auth`` BMON page to complete the process. Here is an
      example of the ``ecobee-auth`` page that generates the 4-character
      PIN: 

      .. image:: /_static/ecobee_pin.png
         :align: center


   *  After clicking the button for Step 2, a new page appears with a
      box containing two important token strings: 

      .. image:: /_static/ecobee_auth_tokens.png
         :align: center


   *  Use your mouse to select and then copy the ``access_token`` and
      ``refresh_token`` text in the box. Paste this text into the
      "Script Parameters in YAML form" input box for the Periodic Script
      you are setting up. Here is an example of how the inputs should
      look for the Periodic Script: 

      .. image:: /_static/ecobee_auth_inputs.png
         :align: center


The script above will collect data from *all* of the thermostats in the
Ecobee Account that went through the authorization process. Currently,
there is no limit on the number of thermostats that can be added to one
Ecobee account. If you wish to collect data from other Ecobee accounts,
you need to set up a separate Periodic Script for each account. Each
account will have to go through the authorization process described
above, and separate tokens will be created for each account.

The initial authorization tokens that were acquired through the above
process will expire. BMON knows how to acquire fresh tokens and will do
so without any intervention by a user. Because the initial tokens
acquired above are quickly invalid, BMON deletes those tokens out of the
"Script Parameters" input box. If you re-open the Periodic Script
configuration screen, you will see that the ``access_token`` and
``refresh_token`` entries are gone. This is not cause for alarm, as BMON
internally has the new tokens stored.

If the Account owner removes the BMON Application from the Ecobee
account, or if some other authorization problem occurs, you will have to
use the ``ecobee-auth`` page again to acquire new tokens. Enter the new
tokens into the "Script Parameters" input box to restore BMON's access
to the Ecobee account.

Other Notes on Ecobee Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some additional notes on configuring Ecobee Periodic
Scripts.

For the ``File name of script`` input, the value must be ``ecobee``. A
good use for the ``Optional Description`` input is to put the name of
the Ecobee Account that is accessed by the script. For the
``How often should script run`` input, the best value is "10 min",
because the Ecobee API server returns data from three sequential
5-minute intervals, totalling 15 minutes of data. Polling the server
every 10 minutes ensures that the server will be polled at least once
during every 15-minute interval.

For the ``Script Parameters in YAML form`` input, there is currently
only one possible parameter other than the initial ``access_token`` and
``refresh_token`` parameters that are entered during the authorization
process described above. That one parameter is:

``include_occupancy*`` Possible values are ``True`` or ``False``. If
the parameter is set to ``True``, the script will collect occupancy
values reported by the occupancy sensor in in the main thermostat and
the occupancy values reported by any remote thermostats. For Ecobee3
Lite thermostats, no occupancy sensors are present, so no occupancy
values can be collected, irrespective of the ``include_occupancy``
parameter value.

After the Ecobee Periodic Script is properly configured and saved,
collection of Ecobee data will begin. Successfully collected sensor
readings will be stored in the BMON sensor reading database. However,
these readings will not be displayed in the BMON graphing and report
interface until each individual sensor is configured in the BMON system.
See the :ref:`adding-sensors` section for the process of adding a sensor 
into the BMON system. This process assigns an
understandable name to the sensor, puts the sensor in an appropriate
Sensor Group, and assigns the sensor to one or more buildings.

When adding a sensor to the BMON system, the sensor's ID must be entered
into the ``Sensor ID, or Calculated Field ID`` input. For each of the
sensor readings collected by the Ecobee script, a Sensor ID is created.
The table below shows an example of the Sensor ID's that are created by
the script. This table is based on an Ecobee Thermostat **serial number of**
``311015614158`` and a **Remote Sensor code** (found on the back of the
remote sensor) of ``CK2W``. Your actual Sensor IDs will be based on your
Thermostat Serial Number and your Remote Sensor Codes.

+-------------+-----------------+

+-------------+-----------------+

The occupancy readings are only included if ``include_occupancy`` is set
to True in the Script Parameters. The Remote Sensor values are repeated
for every remote sensor associated with the thermostat. Remote Sensors
are not supported by the Ecobee3 Lite thermostat.

Collect Data from Okofen Wood Pellet Boilers
--------------------------------------------

Wood pellet boilers manufactured by `Okofen <http://www.okofen.co.uk/>`_
have a data collection system that can be accessed from the Internet. A
BMON Periodic Script is available to collect data from such a boiler.

The boiler creates a daily CSV file containing one-minute resolution
values of various boiler parameters. The Okofen web interface to the
boiler allows you to determine which boiler parameters are collected and
stored in the CSV file. Please see Okofen documentation for the process
of selecting and enabling those parameters.

The rest of this section describes the process for configuring the
Periodic Script in BMON that acquires and stores the data from the
Okofen CSV files. As well as this documentation, there is also a :download:`Powerpoint Presentation </_static/Okofen_BMON_setup.pptx>` 
that explains the configuration process.

The screenshot below shows an example of a configured Periodic Script
for collecting data from an Okofen boiler:

.. image:: /_static/okofen_config.png
  :align: center

The ``File name of script`` must be ``okofen``. The Okofen boiler
creates a new CSV file once per day, presumably shortly after Midnight.
There is little harm in allowing the BMON Periodic Script to run much
more frequently, as it simply exits if it has already downloaded the
newest file. ``30 min`` is a good choice. If Internet access to the
boiler is unavailable for a period of time, BMON will automatically
retrieve multiple days of missed CSV files when Internet connectivity is
restored.

The ``Script Parameters in YAML form`` input can include the following
parameters:

**url:** (required) This is the URL for accessing the Okofen boiler. The
boiler access is usually on port 8888, so the URL must include this port
number. Here is an example: ``http://64.182.156.18:8888``

**site_id:** (required) This string ID is used to create unique Sensor
IDs for the values extracted from the boiler. A short descriptor of the
site is best, with no spaces in the string.

**tz_data:** (optional, defaults to ``US/Alaska``) The
controller/data-collector in the boiler has a timezone setting that
affects the timestamps of the values it records in the CSV files. The
timezone may not be correctly set to the location of the boiler, for
example the Hawaii timezone has been used for Alaskan boilers. Set this
parameter to a timezone string found in `this timezone database
list <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones>`_.

**last_date_loaded:** (optional, normally determined from the last run
of the script) The script internally keeps track of the last CSV file it
successfully loaded, and then will request files after that date in
subsequent runs of the script. If the script has never been run before,
the first file it attempts to load is from a day two weeks ago. This is
rarely necessary, but you can override this behavior by entering in a
``last_date_loaded`` in a form like '2016-11-23'. When the script next
runs, it will start loading CSV files one day after that date. You might
use the parameter to avoid loading two weeks of older CSV files on the
initial run of the script. It is difficult to determine a case where you
would want to leave this parameter for more than one run of the script,
as the script internally tracks the last CSV file loaded.

The ``okofen`` Periodic Script collects all of the sensor values that
have been enabled in the Okofen boiler. Each of these sensor values is
assigned a Sensor ID by BMON. The table below gives examples of how the
Okofen sensor names are translated into BMON Sensor IDs.

The example in the table assumes that the ``site_id`` in the
``Script Parameters`` input box was set to ``HainesSrCtr``:

+----------------------------+--------------------------+
| Okofen Sensor Name         | BMON Sensor ID           |
+============================+==========================+
| P107 Flue/Flame temp       | HainesSrCtr_P107         |
+----------------------------+--------------------------+
| P112 Burner Startups       | HainesSrCtr_P112         |
+----------------------------+--------------------------+
| Boiler 1                   | HainesSrCtr_boiler_1     |
+----------------------------+--------------------------+

Here is the general rule. All BMON Sensor IDs start with the ``site_id``
followed by an underbar character. Then, if the Okofen sensor name
contains a 3-digit parameter number in the form Pxxx, that parameter
number (including the leading 'P') is added to the BMON Sensor ID. If
there is no parameter number in the Okofen sensor name, a translated
version of the Okofen name is added to the BMON Sensor ID. The
translation converts all spaces and slashes to the underbar character,
removes all period characters, and converts all letters to lower case.

In order to see these sensors in the normal data display and analysis
portion of BMON, they must be added to the ``Sensors`` table in the BMON
Admin interface. This process is documented in the "Adding Sensors"
section of the :ref:`adding-buildings-and-sensors` document.

There is also a special ``Calculated Field`` function available that can
create a Sensor that estimates the pellet consumption or heat output of
the boiler by examining the Status (P241 parameter number) sensor of the
boiler. See the :ref:`calculated-fields` document for more details.

Send BMON Data to an InfluxDB Time-Series Database
--------------------------------------------------

`InfluxDB <https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/>`_ is a database
optimized for storing and querying Time Series data, such as the data
collected from sensors. This database is also supported as a data source
for the `Grafana Time Series Analytics
package <https://grafana.com/>`_, which is a leading software package
for creating graphical dashboards displaying time-series data. Both
InfluxDB and Grafana are open source software. A BMON Periodic Script is
available that will periodically send all new BMON sensor data to an
InfluxDB database. An installation of Grafana can then display that data
in a dashboard.

To understand the configuration of this Periodic Script, you need to have a
reasonable understanding of the use of an InfluxDB database, as
described on the `InfluxDB documentation
page <https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/>`_.

Here is a screenshot of a sample Periodic Script configuration that
sends data to an InfluxDB database:

.. image:: /_static/influxdb_config.png
  :align: center

The ``File name of script`` must be ``influxdb``. The
``Script Parameters in YAML form`` input can include the following
parameters:

**influx_url:** (required) This is the HTTP URL that allows writing to
the InfluxDB database. If the write does not occur on the standard
HTTP(s) port, then the port number should be included in the URL, as
shown in this example.

**database_name:** (required) An InfluxDB server can contain multiple
databases. In this parameter, specify the name of the InfluxDB database
to write the BMON sensor readings into.

**username:** (required if InfluxDB is using authentication) The
InfluxDB username to authenticate with, which must have write privileges
on the target database.

**password:** (required if InfluxDB is using authentication) The
password associated with the above username.

**measurement:** (defaults to 'reading') Every point in the InfluxDB
database has a "measurement" type associated with it. This Periodic
Script stores all of the BMON sensor readings under one measurement,
which defaults to 'reading'. However, you can change the measurement
type with this parameter.

**value_field:** (defaults to 'value') Every point in the InfluxDB
database has one or more field values. All of the BMON sensor readings
sent by the Periodic Script are stored in one field, and the default
name of that field is 'value'. That field name can be changed with this
parameter.

**reach_back:** (default = 14, measured in days) The first time the
Periodic Script runs, it decides how much historical data to send to
the InfluxDB database.
The ``reach_back`` parameter determines the amount of historical data
sent, and it is measured in days. In subsequent runs of this Script,
only new data is sent to the InfluxDB database.

**ignore_last_rec:** (default = False) If this parameter is set to
True, the script will send all historical data up to the ``reach_back``
limit, even if the script has run before and sent that data. This can be
used to repopulate a database that has been reset or cleaned of old
data. This parameter should *not* be set to True on a continual basis,
as that will cause the Script to send all historical data (up to the
``reach_back`` limit) every time the script runs.

InfluxDB Tags Created during Export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

InfluxDB allows each point in the database to be described by any number
of "tags". A tag is a key/value pair that adds metadata to the database
record. An example tag would be "sensor_id=451897", which gives the
Sensor ID associated with this particular sensor reading. These tags are
used to extract particular data points from the Database. Grafana
knows how to build queries using these tags.

When BMON sends data to the InfluxDB database, it automatically adds a
number of tags to every sensor reading sent. Below is the list of tags
that are automatically created by the BMON Periodic Script. Also note
that all tag values sent by BMON are all "cleaned" by replacing spaces,
the equals sign, and commas with the dash/hyphen character, "-".
Further, if the replacement results in more than one dash in a row, the
string of dashes is reduced to one.

``building_title`` The value of this tag is the title of the Building
associated with the sensor reading (as entered in the 'Buildings' table
of the BMON Admin interface), e.g. 'building_title=Kaluza-House'. Note
that if a sensor reading is associated with *more than one* building,
the sensor reading is sent multiple times to the InfluxDB database, once
for each associated building.

``latitude`` The latitude of the associated Building (again, as entered
in the Building table of the BMON Admin interface).

``longitude`` The longitude of the associated building.

``sensor_group`` The Sensor Group chosen when the sensor was associated
with the Building in BMON.

``sensor_id`` The Sensor ID for the sensor, as entered in the
``Sensors`` table in the BMON Admin interface.

``sensor_title`` The Sensor Title, as entered in the ``Sensors`` table
in the BMON Admin interface.

``unit`` The measurement unit type for the sensor, such as 'deg-F' or
'kWh'.

The above tags are always included with every sensor reading point sent
to InfluxDB. In addition, you can have other tags sent with the readings
by filling in ``Additional Properties`` input boxes found in both the
``Buildings`` BMON Admin table and in the ``Sensors`` BMON Admin table.
Any key/value pairs that you enter into these areas will also be sent
along with the readings to InfluxDB. Here is an example of two
additional properties that were entered for a particular Building:


.. image:: /_static/additional_props.png
  :align: center

For all sensors associated with that building, these properties will be
made into key/value pairs and sent as tags with the sensor readings. Tag
Names will be "cleaned" by substituting the underbar "_" character for
spaces and Tag Values will be "cleaned" by substituting the dash
character "-" for spaces.

Also, if any of the Additional Properties for a Building or Sensor use
the same Tag Name as an automatically-created Tag Name, the user-entered
Tag will override the automatically-created Tag.

When creating dashboards in Grafana, all of the Tag Names and Values
will automatically be displayed as choice lists when creating data
queries to feed your dashboard.
